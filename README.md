# ascii-graph-py
ascii-graph-py is a versatile Python library that generates ASCII art representations of data, including line graphs, bar graphs, and pie charts. Originally inspired by and ported from the C implementation in TheNetNode (src/graph.c), it has been extended with additional features like customizable pie chart sizes, fill options, and more. Whether you're visualizing data in a terminal or just love retro text-based graphics, this tool provides an easy-to-use solution with flexible configuration options.

## Features
- **Line Graphs**: Plot data points or lines with customizable scaling.
- **Bar Graphs**: Display data as filled bars.
- **Pie Charts**: Render circular charts with optional filling and adjustable radius.
- Lightweight and dependency-free (uses only Python's standard library).
- Inspired by classic ASCII art, modernized for flexibility.

## Installation
No external dependencies are required! Simply download the script and use it in your Python project.
